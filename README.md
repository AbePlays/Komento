# Komento

Komento is an interactive comments section. The app is server rendered and the server cache on client-side is handled by `svelte-query` to provide optimistic updates ðŸ˜‡

Current Implementation involves following functionality:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote content

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Design preview for the Interactive comments section coding challenge](./desktop-preview.jpg)

### Expected behaviour

- Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.
- A confirmation modal should pop up before a comment or reply is deleted.
- Adding a new comment or reply uses the `currentUser` returned from the server on initial page load.
- You can only edit or delete your own comments and replies.
